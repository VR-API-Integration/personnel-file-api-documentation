## Concept

APIs with this status are still under development and the development team is still making changes. Only a sandbox is available to start testing and the API cannot be used with customer environments.

## Controlled Available

APIs (or API versions) with this status are not ready yet to be rolled out to the complete customer base:

* It is available to a few access partners
* Connections of an access partner to the customer environment (tenant) are put on a waiting list, and it will take time before the connection is accepted
* There can be functional limitations of these APIs

Controlled Available APIs have the usual security and support level.

## General Available

APIs (or API versions) with this status are available to all access partners. The API can be used by all customers who use any of the HR Core systems that are supported by this API.

## Deprecated

The API (or API version) is being phased out. We do not accept any new connections on this API (version). We will ask our access partners to move to another interface API. See also your Service Level Agreement
