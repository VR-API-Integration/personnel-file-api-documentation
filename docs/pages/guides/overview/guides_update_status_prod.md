Via the developer portal selfservice function you can only request access for a Sandbox app. You can see the difference on the app with either an orange Sandbox or green Production mark.

If your organization would like to request an app with access to the production environment, please be so kind to contact your organizations customer success manager (account manager) or hr contactperson for this request. They will send in a request to the consulting team for processing of the assignment.  

We would advice to create a separate new app, to be upgraded to production, that way you can keep the current Sandbox app for testing in the future in case you might need that. But that choice is up to you of course. Also it would help with the processing time of mentioned request by providing your accountmanager / hr contactperson with the required information needed for processing such a request. 

* API: File
* Business type id (file type identifier)
* AppId of the app you would like to be upgraded to production access. 
* Email address of a contactperson we can inform once the work is done and the app is ready to use.
