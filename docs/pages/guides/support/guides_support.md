There is a Slack channel available where developers, who might need support to integrate using our APIs, can get in touch with other consumers and even with the actual development team.


You can join [here](https://join.slack.com/t/vismadevelopers/shared_invite/zt-1evhs25as-COSOiI3MQYDymkwYnzo7FQ){:target="_blank"}. Anyone can join!
